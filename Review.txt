README.md is kinda fine.
Only one commit: you didn't use fully github.

Makefile:
  Why when I try to compile your code It doesn't find the std::pow method?
  Why in your makefile you have the options for make parallel? WHy are you linking to the library tbb?

Comments:
  I would have liked to see more comments in the .cpp files

Code Design:
  Why are you defining the parameters with std::pow(10, -6) instead of simply 1e-6?

I would have liked to see the usage of getpot or json or muparser...
